# CSE-440---NLP

Introduction to the field of natural language processing (NLP)- the creation of computer programs that can understand, generate, and learn natural language. The topics include the three major subfields of NLP: syntax (the structure of an utterance), semantics (the truth-functional meaning of an untterance), and pragmatics/discourse (the context-dependent meaning of an utterance). The course will introduce both knowledge-based and statistical methods for NLP, and will illustrate the use of such methods in a variety of of text- and speech-based application areas
